  <h1> Schizophrenia</h1>
  

<section>
<h2 id="a">Overview - Schizophrenia</h2>

<p> Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition. It causes a <br> range of different psychological symptoms.</p>
  <p> Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a type of psychosis. This means <br>  the person may not always be able to distinguish their own <br> thoughts and ideas from reality.
<p>Symptoms of schizophrenia can include:   
<ul>
  <li>hallucinations – hearing or seeing things that do not exist outside of the mind</li>
  <li>delusions – unusual beliefs not based on reality</li>
  <li>muddled thoughts and speech based on hallucinations or delusions</li>
  <li>losing interest in everyday activities</li>
  <li>not wanting to look after yourself and your needs, such as not caring about your personal hygiene</li>
  <li>wanting to avoid people, including friends</li>
  <li>feeling disconnected from your feelings or emotions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>People with schizophrenia do not have a split personality. <br> Schizophrenia does not usually cause someone to be violent.</p>
<br>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="b">When to get medical advice</h2>
<p>If you're experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see a GP as soon as  <br> possible. The earlier schizophrenia is treated, the better.</p>
<p>There's no single test for schizophrenia. It's usually diagnosed after <br> an assessment by a mental health care professional, such as a psychiatrist.</p>
<br>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="c">Causes of schizophrenia</h2>
<p>The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. But most experts <br> believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and <br> environmental factors</p>

 <p>It's thought that some people are more vulnerable to developing<br> schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition such as<br> a stressful life event or drug misuse.<br><br> </p> 
</section> 
<section>
 <h2 id="d">Treating schizophrenia</h2>
 
 <p>Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medicine and<br> therapy tailored to each individual.</p>
<p>In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and <br> cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</p>
<p>People with schizophrenia usually receive help from a community<br> mental health team, which can offer day-to-day support and<br> treatment, depending on the needs of each individual. </p>
<p>Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have<br> periods when symptoms return (relapses).</p>
<p>Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition<br> has on daily life.</p><br>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="e">Living with schizophrenia</h2>
<p>If schizophrenia is well managed, it's possible to reduce the chance of <br>severe relapses.</p>
<p>This can include:
  <ul>
  <li>recognising the signs of an acute episode</li>  
  <li>taking medicine as prescribed</li>  
  <li>talking to others about the condition</li>  
  </ul>
</p>
<p>There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice<br> on living with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar<br> condition.</p> <br>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="f">Symptoms - Schizophrenia</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia changes how a person thinks and behaves.</p>
<p>The condition may develop slowly. The first signs can be hard to <br> identify as they often develop during the teenage years. </p>
<p>Symptoms such as becoming socially withdrawn and unresponsive or <br> changes in sleeping patterns can be mistaken for an adolescent <br> "phase".</p>
<p>People often have episodes of schizophrenia, during which their <br> symptoms are particularly severe, followed by periods where they <br> experience few or no symptoms. This is known as acute schizophrenia.</p>
<h3>Positive and negative symptoms</h3>
<p>The symptoms of schizophrenia are usually classified into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>positive symptoms</strong> – any change in behaviour or thoughts, such as<br> hallucinations or delusions</li>
<li><strong>negative symptoms</strong> – where people appear to withdraw from the<br> world around then, take no interest in everyday social interactions,<br> and often appear emotionless and flat</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="g">Diagnosis - Schizophrenia</h2>
  <p>There's no single test for schizophrenia and the condition is usually <br> diagnosed after assessment by a specialist in mental health.</p>
  <p>If you're concerned you may be developing symptoms of<br> schizophrenia, see a GP as soon as possible. The earlier schizophrenia is<br> treated, the better.</p>
  <p>The GP will ask about your symptoms and check they're not the<br> result of other causes, such as recreational drug use.</p>
