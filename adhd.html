			<h1>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <br>(ADHD)</h1>
			<section>
   <h2>overview</h2>
  <p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that affects people's behaviour. People with ADHD can seem restless, may have trouble concentrating and may act on impulse</p>

<br>Symptoms of ADHD tend to be noticed at an early age and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school.
<br>  Most cases are diagnosed when children are under 12 years old, but sometimes it's diagnosed later in childhood.
<br>  Sometimes ADHD was not recognised when someone was a child, and they are diagnosed later as an adult.
<br>  The symptoms of ADHD may improve with age, but many adults who were diagnosed with the condition at a young age continue to experience problems.
<br>  People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders.
</section> 
<section>
    <h3>Getting help</h3>
    <p>Many children go through phases where they're restless or inattentive. This is often completely normal and does not necessarily mean they have ADHD.
But you should discuss your concerns with your child's teacher, their school's special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) or a GP if you think their behaviour may be different from most children their age.
<br>It's also a good idea to speak to a GP if you're an adult and think you may have ADHD, but were not diagnosed with the condition as a child.
<br>What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
<br>The exact cause of ADHD is unknown, but the condition has been shown to run in families.
<p>Other factors suggested as potentially having a role in ADHD include:</p>
   <ul>
<li>being born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy)</li>
<li>having a low birthweight</li>
<li>smoking or alcohol or drug abuse during pregnancy</li>
   </ul>
<br>ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it's more coParents of children with ADHDmmon in people with learning difficulties.</p>
<br>How attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is treated
<br>Parents of children with ADHD
<br>Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they cannot help their behaviour.
<br>Some day-to-day activities might be more difficult for you and your child,
</section>
<section>
<p>including:</p>
     <ul>
<li>getting your child to sleep at night</li>
<li>getting ready for school on time</li>
<li>listening to and carrying out instructions</li>
<li>being organised</li>
<li>social occasions</li>
<li>shopping</li>
     </ul>
<p>Adults with ADHD</p>
Adults with ADHD may find they have problems with:
     <ul>
<li>organisation and time management</li>
<li>following instructions</li>
<li>focusing and completing tasks</li>
<li>implsiveness and risk taking</li>
     </ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="a"> Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):</p>
<br>The symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be categorised into 2 types of behavioural problems:
  <ul>
<li>inattentiveness (difficulty concentrating and focusing)</li>
<li>hyperactivity and impulsiveness</li>
  </ul>
<br>Many people with ADHD have problems that fall into both these categories, but this is not always the case.
<br>For example, around 2 to 3 in 10 people with the condition have problems with concentrating and focusing, but not with hyperactivity or impulsiveness.
<br>This form of ADHD is also known as attention deficit disorder (ADD). ADD can sometimes go unnoticed because the symptoms may be less obvious.
<br>ADHD is more often diagnosed in boys than girls. Girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattentiveness only, and are less likely to show disruptive behaviour that makes ADHD symptoms more obvious. This means girls who have ADHD may not always be diagnosed.
Symptoms in children and teenagers
<br>The symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers are well defined, and they're usually noticeable before the age of 6. They occur in more than 1 situation, such as at home and at school.
<br>Children may have symptoms of both inattentiveness and hyperactivity and impulsiveness, or they may have symptoms of just 1 of these types of behaviour.
</section>
<section>
<p>Inattentiveness (difficulty concentrating and focusing)</p>
    <ul>
<li>having a short attention span and being easily distracted</li>
<li>careless mistakes – for example, in schoolwork</li>
<li>appearing forgetful or losing things</li>
<li>being unable to stick to tasks that are tedious or time-consuming</li>
<li>to be unable to listen to or carry out instructions</li>
<li>constantly changing activity or task</li>
<li>having difficulty organising tasks</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<p>Hyperactivity and impulsiveness</p>
The main signs of hyperactivity and impulsiveness are:
   <ul>
<li>being unable to sit still, especially in calm or quiet surroundings</li>
<li>constantly fidgeting</li>
<li>being unable to concentrate on tasks</li>
<li>excessive physical movement</li>
<li>excessive talking</li>
<li>being unable to wait their turn</li>
<li>acting without thinking</li>
<li>interrupting conversations</li>
<li>little or no sense of danger</li>
   </ul>
These symptoms can cause significant problems in a child's life, such as underachievement at school, poor social interaction with other children and adults, and problems with discipline.
  </section>
  <section>
<p>Symptoms in adults</p>
<br>
In adults, the symptoms of ADHD are more difficult to define. This is largely due to a lack of research into adults with ADHD.
<br>As ADHD is a developmental disorder, it's believed it cannot develop in adults without it first appearing during childhood. But symptoms of ADHD in children and teenagers often continue into adulthood.
<br>The way in which inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness affect adults can be very different from the way they affect children.
<br>For example, hyperactivity tends to decrease in adults, while inattentiveness tends to remain as the pressures of adult life increase.
<br>Adult symptoms of ADHD also tend to be far more subtle than childhood symptoms.
<br>
Some specialists have suggested the following as a list of symptoms associated with ADHD in adults:
   <ul>
<li>carelessness and lack of attention to detail</li>
<li>continually starting new tasks before finishing old ones</li>
<li>poor organisational skills</li>
<li>inability to focus or prioritise</li>
<li>continually losing or misplacing things</li>
<li>difficulty keeping quiet, and speaking out of turn</li>
<li>blurting out responses and often interrupting others</li>
<li> swings, irritability and a quick temper</li>
<li>inability to deal with stress</li>
   </ul>
taking risks in activities, often with little or no regard for personal safety or the safety of others – for example, driving dangerously
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="b">Causes</h2>
<p>The exact cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is not fully understood, although a combination of factors is thought to be responsible.</p>
ADHD tends to run in families and, in most cases, it's thought the genes you inherit from your parents are a significant factor in developing the condition.
<br>Research shows that parents and siblings of someone with ADHD are more likely to have ADHD themselves.
<br>However, the way ADHD is inherited is likely to be complex and is not thought to be related to a single genetic fault.
<br>
<p>Brain function and structure</p>
<br>Research has identified a number of possible differences in the brains of people with ADHD from those without the condition, although the exact significance of these is not clear.
<br>For example, studies involving brain scans have suggested that certain areas of the brain may be smaller in people with ADHD, whereas other areas may be larger.
<br>Other studies have suggested that people with ADHD may have an imbalance in the level of neurotransmitters in the brain, or that these chemicals may not work properly.
</section>
<section>
<p>Groups at risk</p>
<br>
Certain people are also believed to be more at risk of ADHD, including people.
    <ul>
<li>who were born prematurely (before the 37th week of pregnancy) or with a low birthweight</li>
<li>with epilepsy</li>
<li>with brain damage – which happened either in the womb or after a severe head injury later in life</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2 id="c">  Dignosis  </h2>
<p>If you think you or your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speak to a GP. You can also speak to your child’s
  teacher or their school’s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO).</p>
<br>
The GP cannot formally diagnose ADHD, but they can discuss your concerns with you and refer you for a specialist assessment, if necessary. Your school may also be able to arrange a specialist referral for your child.
<p>When you see a GP, they may ask you:</p>
   <ul>
<li>about your symptoms or those of your child</li>
<li>when these symptoms started</li>
<li>where the symptoms occur – for example, at home, in school, college or university, or at work</li>
<li>whether the symptoms affect your or your child's day-to-day life – for example, if they make socialising difficult</li>
<li>if there have been any recent significant events in your or your child's life, such as a death or divorce in the family</li>
<li>if there's a family history of ADHD</li>
<li>about any other problems or symptoms of different health conditions you or your child may have</li>
   </ul>
</section>
<section>
<p>Children and teenagers</p>
If the GP thinks your child may have ADHD, they may first suggest a period of "watchful waiting" – lasting around 10 weeks – to see if your child's symptoms improve, stay the same or get worse.
<br>They may also suggest starting a group-based, ADHD-focused parent training or education programme. Being offered a parent training and education programme does not mean you have been a bad parent – it aims to teach you ways of helping yourself and your child.
<p>Adults</p>
For adults with possible ADHD, the GP will assess your symptoms and may refer you for an assessment if:
   <ul>
<li>you were not diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but your symptoms began during childhood and have been ongoing since</li>
<li>your symptoms cannot be explained by a mental health condition</li>
<li>your symptoms significantly affect your day-to-day life – for example, if you're underachieving at work or find intimate relationships difficult</li>
   </ul>
You may also be referred to a specialist if you had ADHD as a child or young person and your symptoms are now causing moderate or severe functional impairment.

<p>Diagnosis in children and teenagers</p>
Diagnosing ADHD in children depends on a set of strict criteria. To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must have 6 or more symptoms of inattentiveness, or 6 or more symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsiveness
To be diagnosed with ADHD, your child must also have:
    <ul>
<li>been displaying symptoms continuously for at least 6 months</li>
<li>started to show symptoms before the age of 12</li>
<li>been showing symptoms in at least 2 different settings – for example, at home and at school, to rule out the possibility that
    the behaviour is just a reaction to certain teachers or to parental control</li>
<li>symptoms that make their lives considerably more difficult on a social, academic or occupational level</li>
<li>symptoms that are not just part of a developmental disorder or difficult phase, and are not better accounted for by another condition</li>
    </ul>
<p>Diagnosis in adults</p>
<br>Diagnosing ADHD in adults is more difficult because there's some disagreement about whether the list of symptoms used to diagnose children and teenagers also applies to adults.
<br>In some cases, an adult may be diagnosed with ADHD if they have 5 or more of the symptoms of inattentiveness, or 5 or more of hyperactivity and impulsiveness, listed in diagnostic criteria for children with ADHD.
<br>As part of your assessment, the specialist will ask about your present symptoms. However, under current diagnostic guidelines, a diagnosis of ADHD in adults cannot be confirmed unless your symptoms have been present from childhood.
<br>If you find it difficult to remember whether you had problems as a child, your specialist may wish to see your old school records, or talk to your parents, teachers or anyone else who knew you well when you were a child.

<h2 id="d">Treatment</h2>
<p>Treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can help relieve the symptoms and make the condition much less of a problem in day-to-day life.</p>
<br>ADHD can be treated using medicine or therapy, but a combination of both is often best.
<br>Treatment is usually arranged by a specialist, such as a paediatrician or psychiatrist, although the condition may be monitored by a GP.
<p>Medicine:</p>
There are 5 types of medicine licensed for the treatment of ADHD:
   <ul>
<il>methylphenidate</li>
<li>lisdexamfetamine</li>
<li>dexamfetamine</li>
<li>atomoxetine</li>
<li>guanfacine</li>
   </ul>
These medicines are not a permanent cure for ADHD but may help someone with the condition concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer, and learn and practise new skills.
<br>Some medicines need to be taken every day, but some can be taken just on school days. Treatment breaks are occasionally recommended to assess whether the medicine is still needed.
<br>If you were not diagnosed with ADHD until adulthood, a GP and specialist can discuss which medicines and therapies are suitable for you.
<br>If you or your child is prescribed one of these medicines, you'll probably be given small doses at first, which may then be gradually increased. You or your child will need to see a GP for regular check-ups to ensure the treatment is working effectively and check for signs of any side effects or problems.It's important to let the GP know about any side effects and talk to them if you feel you need to stop or change treatment.
<br>Your specialist will discuss how long you should take your treatment but, in many cases, treatment is continued for as long as it is helping

  <h2 id="e">Living with</h2>
  <br>Living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be difficult, as the symptoms can make everyday activities more of a challenge.
  <br>It's important to get the support you need to understand and cope with your or your child's condition.
  <br>Ways to cope for parents of children with ADHD
  <br>Caring for a child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can be challenging. The impulsive, fearless and chaotic behaviours typical of ADHD can make everyday activities exhausting and stressful.
  <br>Although it can be difficult at times, it's important to remember that a child with ADHD cannot help their behaviour. People with ADHD can find it difficult to suppress impulses, which means they may not stop to consider a situation, or the consequences, before they act.
