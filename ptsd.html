    <h1><strong> Post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD)</strong> </h1>

    <section>  
          <h2 id="a">Overview Of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder(PTSD)</h2> 
        <p> Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. </p>
    </section>

    <section>
       
        <h2 id="b">Symptoms Of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) </h2>
       <p>
        Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashback, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt.
        <br>
        They may also have problems sleeping and find concentrating difficult.
     <br>
     These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life.
       </p>

<br>
        PTSD symptoms include:
        <ul>
        <li>Troubling memories</Li>
        <li> Vivid flashbacks</Li>
         <li>Consistent negative mood</Li>
        <li>Being easily startled</Li>
        <li>Avoiding reminders of the trauma</Li>
        <li>Feeling depressed</Li>
        <li>Blaming oneself for the event</Li>
        <li>Having problems concentrating or sleeping</Li>
        <li>Feeling irritable or easily agitated </Li>
        <li>Loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities</Li>
        <li>Feeling detached from others</Li>

        </ul>
    </section>    
    <section>
        <h2 id="c">Causes Of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <p>Any situation that a person finds traumatic can cause PTSD</p>
<br>
These can include:
<ul>  
    <li>serious road accidents</li>
    <li>violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery</li>
    <li>serious health problems</li>
    <li>childbirth experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>PTSD can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event, or it can occur weeks, months or even years later.</p>


<p>PTSD is estimated to affect about 1 in every 3 people who have a traumatic experience, but it's not clear exactly why some people develop the condition and others do not.
</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 id="d">Diagnosing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <p>
            NYU Langone specialists diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
            <br>
             This is an anxiety disorder that develops after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic, life-threatening event, 
             such as a natural disaster, violent personal assault, serious accident, or war.
             <br>
        </p>

        <p>Shock, fear, upsetting memories, jumpiness, nightmares, or trouble sleeping are common after a traumatic event. For most people, 
            these reactions diminish over time. But for people with PTSD, they remain intense.</p>
        <p>A person with PTSD may feel stressed or frightened, even when he or she is no longer in danger. 
            These feelings may become so strong that they affect the way 
            a person lives his or her life.</p>
        <p>NYU Langone specialists are experts at diagnosing and treating PTSD in military veterans,
    active duty service members, and their families.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 id="e">Treatment Of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <p>The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are talking therapies and medicine.
            <br>


            Traumatic events can be very difficult to come to terms with, but confronting your feelings and getting professional 
            help is often the only way of effectively treating PTSD.
            <br>
            

            It's possible for PTSD to be successfully treated many years after the traumatic event or events occurred, 
            which means it's never too late to get help.
            <br>

            PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event.
            <br>
            Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and how soon they occur after the traumatic event.
             <br>
        </p>
        <br>
            Any of the following treatment options may be recommended:
            <ul>
           <li>watchful waiting – monitoring  symyourptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without treatment</li>
           <li> antidepressants – such as paroxetine or sertraline</li>
           <li> talking therapies – such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and
            reprocessing (EMDR)</li>
            </ul>
        
    </section>
    <section>

         <h2 id="i">Medicine Of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        
<P>The 2 medicines recommended to treat PTSD in adults are paroxetine and sertraline.
    <br>

Paroxetine and sertraline are both a type of antidepressant known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
<br>
</P>
<br>

These medicines will only be used if:
<ul>
<li> choose not to have trauma-focused psychological treatment</li>
<li>psychological treatment would not be effective because there's an ongoing threat of further trauma (such as domestic violence)</li>
<li>you have gained little or no benefit from a course of trauma-focused psychological treatment</li>
<li>you have an underlying medical condition, such as severe depression, that significantly affects your ability to benefit 
from psychological treatment</li>
<li>Sometimes other antidepressants, such as venlafaxine, may be prescribed, but they are not licensed to treat PTSD.</li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines are not usually prescribed for people younger than 18 unless recommended by a specialist.<br>

If medicine for PTSD is effective, it'll usually be continued for a minimum of 12 months before being gradually
 withdrawn over the course of 4 weeks or longer.
 <br>

If a medicine is not effective at reducing your symptoms, your dosage may be increased.
<br>

Before prescribing a medicine, your doctor should inform you about possible side effects you may have while taking it, 
along with any possible withdrawal symptoms when the medicine is withdrawn.
<br>

For example, common side effects of paroxetine include feeling sick, blurred vision, constipation and diarrhoea.<br>

Possible withdrawal symptoms associated with paroxetine include sleep disturbances, intense dreams, anxiety and irritability.

Withdrawal symptoms are less likely if the medicine is reduced slowly.
<br>
<br>

Children and young people:
<br>
<br>
Trauma-focused CBT is usually recommended for children and young people with PTSD.
<br>

This normally involves a course of 6 to 12 sessions that have been adapted to suit the child's age, circumstances and level of development.

Where appropriate, treatment includes consulting with and involving the child's family.

Children who do not respond to trauma-focused CBT may be offered EMDR.

    <p>PTSD is a debilitating disorder that can affect a person’s everyday life. Learn what is is like to live with PTSD and the steps people
         can take to cope with the disorder.
         <br>
        When someone experiences a traumatic event, it may cause them to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) later on in life. 
        <br>
        Living with PTSD can be debilitating 
        and may affect a person’s ability to function healthily in their everyday life. They may feel alone and helpless.
        <br>
         However, PTSD is a common anxiety disorder and there are multiple treatment options to help someone address the disorder and recover
          from the traumatic event.
